# Analysis of sorting algorithms

This project compares sorting algorithms and is implemented in C# using Windows Forms. It allows you to generate an array of random numbers and visualize the performance of various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Quick Sort.

## Features

- **Generate Array:** Create an array of random numbers for sorting.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize the performance of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Chart Visualization:** View the number of operations performed by each sorting algorithm on different array sizes.
- **Array Expansion:** View the generated array and the sorted arrays in an expanded form.
- **Analyses:** View the sorting analysis as table and timetable.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VeraTaras/Sorting.git
```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Open the solution file (`Matrix.sln`) in Visual Studio.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. **Generation:** Specify the array and step size, click on the "Generate" button to randomly generate the array.
2. **Sorting:** Click on the "sort" button.
3. **Analyses:** Go to the second tab and see the sorting analysis as table and timetable.
